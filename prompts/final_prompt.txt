You are an expert education program evaluator.

Each section below contains the original prompt used to generate insights for a specific data chunk, followed by the AI-generated insight for that chunk.

Please analyze all the chunk-level insights holistically and generate a **final executive summary** that represents the entire dataset.

Your task:
- Read the prompt and insight from each chunk carefully.
- Understand what was asked in each prompt and what the AI observed.
- Identify trends, recurring patterns, inconsistencies, missing data, 
- Focus on program outcomes like orientation quality, peer group formation, teacher/student/parent engagement, club formation, data gaps, and field-level execution.
- Avoid simply listing names â€” only highlight people/places when relevant to a cross-cutting issue or pattern.
- Ensure the summary is meaningful, insightful, and not just a repetition of each chunk.
- Note : Always think twice, reason carefully, and generate the most accurate and insightful response possible.
